# Simple walk-through outline

When demonstrating, follow these steps. 

## Overview  

1) Start with overview of model classes
2) Show creation of Characters
3) Show default Characters
4) Run the program and see a couple things in PerformAction

## Singleton Pattern

1) Show the instances of new random() in the solution
2) Create the new static singleton for roller
3) Implement the random and roller
4) Replace calls to new random with the Roller Singleton
5) Talk briefly about the problem with it being injected into the model class without injection in the constructor
6) Create a couple characters and run it with breakpoints on the new  Random.  Note it is only hit once in the entire solution
